percolation_problem
===================
Given a 2-d array of 0s and 1s, find a path from top to bottom.  You can only move on 1s and you can only move right and 
down, only only if there's a one.

Example:

		1,0,0,0,0
		1,0,0,1,0
		1,1,1,0,0
		0,1,1,0,0
		0,0,1,0,0
		
  Output path: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)
  
There can be multiple paths.
